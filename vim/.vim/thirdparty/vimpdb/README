    * Tired of debugging Python using print statements? 
    * Don't like the cumbersome PDB (Python debugger) console? 
    * Prefer using Vim for coding your Python programs? 

VimPdb is the solution - allows debugging Python in an IDE-fashion, right within the Vim editor.

Features:
    * Highlighting of currently debugged line and breakpoint lines.
    * F5 - Run/continue running.
    * F2 - Toggle breakpoint at current line
    * Ctrl-F2 / Shift-F2 - Toggle conditional/temporary breakpoint.
    * F7 / F8 - Step into/over
    * F12 - Print stack trace
    * F3 / Ctrl-F3 - Eval/Exec a given statement (in the current debugging context)
    * Save/load breakpoints into session files.
    * Cross-platform
    * And many more... See readme.txt for details

Important Notes

    * It's still considered Beta, so I'm not too sure about its stability or lack of bugs. However, I do appreciate if you could report bugs, suggest features or help out with the known issues (see "Known Issues" section in readme.txt). Email me at vimpdb@gmail.com
    * It's possible to easily implement the debugging capabilities for another editor (e.g. Emacs) - you could write a Python class of your own, which inherits from the PdbIDE class, and implements editor-specific functionalities (such as highlighting).
